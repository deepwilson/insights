            "content": "About . This notebook is a demonstration of some of capabilities of fastpages with notebooks. . With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. . The comment #hide_input was used to hide the code that produced this. . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . . place a #collapse-output flag at the top of any cell if you want to put the output under a collapsable element that is closed by default, but give the reader the option to open it: . print(&#39;The comment #collapse-output was used to collapse the output of this cell by default but you can expand it.&#39;) . The comment #collapse-output was used to collapse the output of this cell by default but you can expand it. . . Interactive Charts With Altair . Charts made with Altair remain interactive. Example charts taken from this repo, specifically this notebook. . Example 1: DropDown . # use specific hard-wired values as the initial selected values selection = alt.selection_single( name=&#39;Select&#39;, fields=[&#39;Major_Genre&#39;, &#39;MPAA_Rating&#39;], init={&#39;Major_Genre&#39;: &#39;Drama&#39;, &#39;MPAA_Rating&#39;: &#39;R&#39;}, bind={&#39;Major_Genre&#39;: alt.binding_select(options=genres), &#39;MPAA_Rating&#39;: alt.binding_radio(options=mpaa)} ) # scatter plot, modify opacity based on selection alt.Chart(df).mark_circle().add_selection( selection ).encode( x=&#39;Rotten_Tomatoes_Rating:Q&#39;, y=&#39;IMDB_Rating:Q&#39;, tooltip=&#39;Title:N&#39;, opacity=alt.condition(selection, alt.value(0.75), alt.value(0.05)) ) . Example 2: Tooltips . alt.Chart(df).mark_circle().add_selection( alt.selection_interval(bind=&#39;scales&#39;, encodings=[&#39;x&#39;]) ).encode( alt.X(&#39;Rotten_Tomatoes_Rating&#39;, type=&#39;quantitative&#39;), alt.Y(&#39;IMDB_Rating&#39;, type=&#39;quantitative&#39;, axis=alt.Axis(minExtent=30)), # y=alt.Y(&#39;IMDB_Rating:Q&#39;, ), # use min extent to stabilize axis title placement tooltip=[&#39;Title:N&#39;, &#39;Release_Date:N&#39;, &#39;IMDB_Rating:Q&#39;, &#39;Rotten_Tomatoes_Rating:Q&#39;] ).properties( width=500, height=400 ) . Example 3: More Tooltips . label = alt.selection_single( encodings=[&#39;x&#39;], # limit selection to x-axis value on=&#39;mouseover&#39;, # select on mouseover events nearest=True, # select data point nearest the cursor empty=&#39;none&#39; # empty selection includes no data points ) # define our base line chart of stock prices base = alt.Chart().mark_line().encode( alt.X(&#39;date:T&#39;), alt.Y(&#39;price:Q&#39;, scale=alt.Scale(type=&#39;log&#39;)), alt.Color(&#39;symbol:N&#39;) ) alt.layer( base, # base line chart # add a rule mark to serve as a guide line alt.Chart().mark_rule(color=&#39;#aaa&#39;).encode( x=&#39;date:T&#39; ).transform_filter(label), # add circle marks for selected time points, hide unselected points base.mark_circle().encode( opacity=alt.condition(label, alt.value(1), alt.value(0)) ).add_selection(label), # add white stroked text to provide a legible background for labels base.mark_text(align=&#39;left&#39;, dx=5, dy=-5, stroke=&#39;white&#39;, strokeWidth=2).encode( text=&#39;price:Q&#39; ).transform_filter(label), # add text labels for stock prices base.mark_text(align=&#39;left&#39;, dx=5, dy=-5).encode( text=&#39;price:Q&#39; ).transform_filter(label), data=stocks ).properties( width=500, height=400 ) . Data Tables . You can display tables per the usual way in your blog: . df[[&#39;Title&#39;, &#39;Worldwide_Gross&#39;, &#39;Production_Budget&#39;, &#39;Distributor&#39;, &#39;MPAA_Rating&#39;, &#39;IMDB_Rating&#39;, &#39;Rotten_Tomatoes_Rating&#39;]].head() .

Note: A doc link to an example website: fast.ai should also work fine. . Footnotes . You can have footnotes in notebooks, however the syntax is different compared to markdown documents. This guide provides more detail about this syntax, which looks like this: . For example, here is a footnote {% fn 1 %}. And another {% fn 2 %} {{ &#39;This is the footnote.&#39; | fndetail: 1 }} {{ &#39;This is the other footnote. You can even have a [link](www.github.com)!&#39; | fndetail: 2 }} . For example, here is a footnote 1. . And another 2 . 1. This is the footnote.↩ . 2. This is the other footnote. You can even have a link!↩ .",

            "title": "An Example Markdown Post",
            "content": "Example Markdown Post . Basic setup . Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format: . YEAR-MONTH-DAY-filename.md . Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code . You can format text and code per usual . General preformatted text: . # Do a thing do_thing() . Python code and output: . # Prints &#39;2&#39; print(1+1) . 2 . Formatting text as shell commands: . echo &quot;hello world&quot; ./some_script.sh --option &quot;value&quot; wget https://example.com/cat_photo1.png . Formatting text as YAML: . key: value - another_key: &quot;another value&quot; . Tables . Column 1 Column 2 . A thing | Another thing | . Tweetcards .
